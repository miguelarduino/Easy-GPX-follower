# Easy-GPX-follower

I'm a enduro motorbike rider with a certain age and a lousy eyesight. 

On my weekend escapades I use my phone to follow GPX tracks. But it is harsh to see the GPX line on the phone. Specially when the sun lights the screen.

Could any one be interested on the development of a android App that simplifies the viewing experience on a phone? It should be a very simple layout with a couple of zoom buttons and some harrows to indicate offset from the track. No need for a underlay map. 

I can not program, but I can design the layout and how it should work.   

Thank you.
